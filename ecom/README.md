# E-commerce Application (Django)

This is a simple Django-based e-commerce application that supports product management and order placement. The application is fully Dockerized to run in a containerized environment with a PostgreSQL database.

## Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Docker (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Setting Up the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IdntKnoWmE/ecommerce-zania.git
cd ecom
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project directory to configure the environment variables required for the application. Hereâ€™s a template for the `.env` file:

```env

# Django settings
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY='django-insecure-*w2u9i=s#v(rb6vytyt5q8&)%f0n__6wtl=^yschkb54_jru3y'
DJANGO_DEBUG=False
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1

# Gunicorn settings
GUNICORN_WORKERS=3
GUNICORN_THREADS=2

# Database Configuration
DB_NAME=zania
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT=5432
```

### 3. Build the Docker Containers

Once the `.env` file is set up, build the Docker containers with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

### 4. Start the Containers

After building the containers, start them using:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start your web application and PostgreSQL database in separate containers. The Django application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000` and the PostgreSQL database will be running on port `5432`.

### 5. Wait for the Database to Be Ready

Once the containers are up, the application will automatically wait for the database to be ready. This is achieved using the `healthcheck` configuration in the `docker-compose.yml` file. 

### 6. Run Migrations

When the application is up and running, you can run the database migrations:

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

This will apply all migrations to your PostgreSQL database.

### 7. Collect Static Files

Once the migrations are done, you need to collect the static files for serving them in production. Run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

### 8. Access the Application

After performing the above steps, your Django application should be running and accessible at:

- **Web Interface**: `http://localhost:8000/`
- **Admin Interface**: `http://localhost:8000/admin/` (Use the superuser credentials created during migration to log in)

### 9. Testing the AI System with Postman
The repository includes a Postman collection that you can use to test the AI system and its related APIs. Follow these steps to use the collection:

1. Import the Postman Collection, 
    Download the Postman collection from the repository or navigate to the Postman folder in the project directory.
    Open the Postman and click on the "Import" button.
    Import the .json file containing the API requests.
2. Set Up Environment Variables in Postman 
   Ensure that you have set up the correct environment variables in Postman for the API requests to work. You may need to configure:
    API base URL: http://localhost:8000/
    Any other required keys or tokens for authentication if applicable.
3. Test the Endpoints
   Once the collection is imported and the environment variables are set, you can run the tests for the system.

### 10. Running Tests

To run the test cases for the application, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py test
```

This will run the Django tests inside the Docker container.

## Docker Compose Overview

The project uses `docker-compose` to manage the services. Here's a breakdown of the services defined in `docker-compose.yml`:

- **db**: PostgreSQL database container, running on port 5432.
- **web**: Django application container, running on port 8000.

The application waits for the PostgreSQL database to be ready using a `healthcheck` mechanism.

## Stopping the Containers

To stop the running containers, use:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This will stop and remove the containers but keep the data in the Docker volumes.

## Troubleshooting

If you face any issues, here are some tips:

- Ensure the PostgreSQL database is running and the username/password are correct.
- If you encounter a `connection refused` error, it might be due to the database not being ready when the application attempts to connect. Wait a few moments and try again.
- Make sure your static files are being collected correctly. If you see missing static files, re-run `collectstatic`.

## Conclusion

You now have a fully functional Django-based e-commerce application running in Docker containers, complete with PostgreSQL as the backend. You can easily modify the application to add more features as needed. 

Feel free to modify the settings and configurations based on your needs, including setting up production-ready configurations for serving static files and using a more robust web server like Nginx.
